2. Importing Playwright test utilities using CommonJS `require` or ES `import`
3. Creating reusable modules and exporting functions
4. Writing the first test using `test()` and the `page` fixture
5. Working with async/await to ensure sequential execution
6. Adding assertions with `expect`
7. Running tests via CLI with `npx playwright test`
8. Running in headed mode and inspecting reports

---

## 💻 Code Snippets
### Importing the Playwright Test Module
```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
```

### Minimal First Test
```javascript
test('My First Test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://google.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Google');
});
```

### Running a Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test tests/my-first-test.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/my-first-test.spec.js --headed
```

### Creating and Exporting Helper Functions (demo)
```javascript
// tests/demo/hello.js
function f1() {
  return 'hello';
}

function f2() {
  return 'hello world';
}

module.exports = { hello: f1, helloWorld: f2 };
```

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Use `const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test')` to import only what you need.
- Place test specs under the autogenerated `tests` directory using the `.spec.js` suffix.
- Wrap Playwright steps inside `async` test blocks and await page interactions.
- `page.goto()` navigates to URLs; assertions like `toHaveTitle` verify the result.
- Running `npx playwright test --headed` shows the browser for easier debugging.
- HTML reports (`npx playwright show-report`) provide rich execution insights.

---

## 🛠️ Commands Used
```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run a specific spec file
npx playwright test tests/my-first-test.spec.js

# Run in headed mode
npx playwright test tests/my-first-test.spec.js --headed

# View HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

---

## 🎓 Odoo-Specific Applications
- Use the same pattern to create Odoo UI smoke tests (login, navigation).
- Centralize Odoo-specific helpers (e.g., authentication, menu navigation) in shared modules and import them as shown.
- Apply async/await to ensure Odoo pages finish loading before validating record views or form submissions.
- Add `expect` assertions for critical Odoo elements such as breadcrumbs, kanban cards, or chatter messages.

---

## ✅ Practice Checklist
- [ ] Create `tests/odoo-login.spec.js` using `test` and `expect` imports.
- [ ] Implement `await page.goto(process.env.ODOO_URL)` and validate the title or login form.
- [ ] Extract helper methods (login, menu navigation) into `tests/utils/odoo.js` and require them.
- [ ] Run the test both headless and headed to observe behaviour.
- [ ] Generate and review the Playwright report for the new test.

hello and welcome i am raghav and today
we are going to start to write our first
test in playwright this is going to be
very easy and very interesting and i
will show you step by step how to write
the first test and we will also see the
syntax the keywords and the commands we
use to run the test and
there will be a quiz i will have the
link for the quiz in the description of
this video and you can take the quiz and
check your knowledge do let me know the
score your score in the comment section
below and if you have any questions you
can let me know in the comments or the q
a session below this video and if you
find this video slow you can increase
the pace of the video from the video
settings so with that let's get started
and let us see how to write our first
test in playwright now step number one
is we will create a new file under the
```

```00:45-05:30:lesson04/lesson-04-transcript.md
test folder so i will go to
my playwright project here and we have
already created this folder and
started the playwright project here and
here we have got a
test
folder created and under the test folder
we have all our test files so we already
have some
sample tests here so you can see this
sample test here this is how we start
uh
let me show you
this is how we start this is how we
write the tests and this is how we write
the steps now do not worry i am going to
start and show you from scratch so i am
going to create a new file under the
test folder now you can
select the test folder and then you can
do a right click and then here select
new file so you can do a right click and
select new file or the other way is you
can select the test folder and here is
the icon
to create a new file so you can also
click here so when you click here
a new file will get created under that
folder that you have selected and here
you can give some name so i will say
uh my first
test and then we say dot
spec dot js
and hit enter and the new file is
created and now here we can start
writing our playwright test now the
first thing is we have to include the
playwright test module into our script
now if i show you
if i go to the
node modules folder of my project
and you will see there is a playwright
module or playwright test package this
is what we need
and from this we need some specific
modules or specific scripts so i will
show you how to do that so here i will
say
require so require is a function it's a
node.js function that is used to
include modules which are present in
external or separate files and that is
the case here we want to include uh some
modules which are present in separate
files so i will use require and then
i can
i will
give these
codes and then you can see i'm getting
this auto suggestion here playwright
test so even if you're not getting you
can start typing or press ctrl space on
your keyboard to get the auto suggestion
box and then select this playwright test
and this will now
include this playwright test module and
all its scripts inside this script that
is my first test and now i can use any
of the scripts any of the modules under
the playwright test package so this is
good however out of all these all the
packages and scripts under the
playwright test package i just need the
test and the expect modules so again if
i show you if i go to the node modules
and go to playwright test
and here if i
show you
if i expand and show you under the test
we have all these
modules and scripts out of this i just
need the test script this is test.js and
i need the expect so test script will be
used to create the test the structure of
the test and expect is used to
uh run the assertions or add any checks
these are the two things i know that
need as of now so for this what i will
do is instead of importing or including
everything i just need these two so i
will say
i can say where or const
this is a keyword in
javascript to declare a variable or a
constant so it's good that you declare
that constant because we don't want to
change these variables or whatever we
write here we don't want to change it or
we don't want anybody or any script to
change these values so i will say const
and i will say test
and
expect and then i will say equals
this
```

```05:30-12:45:lesson04/lesson-04-transcript.md
so this is how we
include the modules
in
a different script or a different module
so this is what you will do and this is
what is mentioned here as well in the
notes i will have all the notes in the
description of this video so you can
always refer the description if you have
any questions or any doubts so require
is a node.js built-in function so make
sure it is not a javascript function it
is a node.js built-in function which is
used to load modules present in separate
files and here we are loading
test and expect modules from the
playwright package so this is important
and if you allow me some more time i can
show you what exactly this is now this
is not what i'm going to tell you may
not be very important from the
automation point of view but it will be
very good if you understand how these
importing and adding the module works so
let's say i will go to my
test folder and i'm going to create one
more folder here so i will click on this
i can do a right click new folder or
click on this icon which will create a
new folder and i will
keep the folder name as demo
so i have created a new folder under the
tests folder and under the demo folder
i'm going to create a file uh let's say
i will call it as
hello.js so i have created a
javascript file hello.js under the demo
folder now here
i am going to create some functions so
in javascript we say
function now uh do not worry uh do not
worry if you don't do not know
javascript what i am going to show is
very very easy and you will get exactly
what i am doing just in case you want to
know more about javascript and the
basics of javascript you can always go
to my
website that is automation step by step
dot com let me show you very quickly
this is just if you want to you know
study more javascript later on
uh let me load this and
see
okay here
you can just search for
javascript
and or you can just go to the
programming section
and here under the programming you will
a
javascript you can directly go on my
youtube channel as well and you will see
the javascript playlist so this will
again take you to the youtube javascript
playlist
and here you will see all the beginner
tutorials on javascript but for now you
can do this later if you want but for
now coming back here i am creating a
function i will say function
f1 you can give any name and then you
give these brackets and the curly
brackets start and stop this is how we
declare a function this is how we create
a function and here i am just returning
a string called
hello
i can create one more function here i
will say function and i will give it a
name f2
and here i am just returning a string
called
hello world so in this module in this
script hello.js i have these two
functions now if i want these functions
to be exposed and if i want these
functions to be included or imported in
any other script or module i will have
to say
exports
i will say exports
and i will
give some name let us say hello
and i will make it equals to this
function similarly for this i will say
dot hello world now this name can be
anything it's not necessary that you
give
the name same as the function name or
same as whatever i am printing here it
can be anything so now i am exporting
these two functions using hello and
hello world and if i have to import it
if i have to add this in any other
script so i'm going back to my
first test and here i will say
require
and i will give the location of the
script or module first so i will say dot
and forward slash and you can see i am
able to see the demo folder and it will
give you auto suggestion if if the demo
folder is uh even above the test folder
then i may have to use double dot and
then it will go one step up and i can
here see node modules and other tests
folder but it is within the test folder
so i will just give a single dot forward
slash and select demo
and then from here i will select the
script or file hello dot js
and then
because from here i just need
the functions are
the properties
hello world so i will use const hello
and hello world equals require from here
and as i told you instead of const i can
use where as well but where means
variable or i can say let let also is
used to declare variable in javascript
but in that case
these will be these can be changed later
on but i don't want this to be changed
anywhere in the script so i am using
const and now
i can say
i can now say
i can call this function
```

```12:45-20:30:lesson04/lesson-04-transcript.md
when i call hello it should call this f1
function and if i say hello world it
should call this f2 function let us see
i will run this and because this is now
a test under playwright to run this i
can say
normally we can say node
and give the location of the file so if
i say node and let me try to say
if it runs this
node and the location of the file that
yes this is running and the reason is
not printing anything because we have
not printed anything here so i will just
say console.log
and then i will call this hello and it
should print whatever is returned from
this hello function which is
hello here so let me now save and run it
and you can see it is printing hello
similarly if i say
if i call hello world i say console.log
and if i say
hello world and you can see i'm also
getting auto suggestions now
so this should print hello world so if i
now again run this
you can see it is printing
hello and hello world here so this is
how you you can include or add modules
and i can actually import it as well
instead of
using this require statement i can say
import
and i can say
hello and
hello world
from
again i will give the location of the
file
or the package demo
hello so if i do this this will also
work so let me now remove all of this
and come back to our test this was for
your knowledge and understanding
so
we can do this or we can say import as i
have shown you we can say import test or
expect from uh at playwright test now
the next step is
we will create our test function now
playwright
library or playwright package
provides a test function and the expect
function to write assertions and that is
what we have already
included or imported in our
script
so now
i will create a
test block
i will create a test block and
we are also getting this auto suggestion
and the syntax is
in the test block or the test function i
will first give the title of the test
and then i will call a function so here
let me give a title within quotes i will
my
first test
i will give a comma here
javascript anonymous function
and for that we just give
these brackets start and close and then
we create an arrow symbol by
using equals sign and
greater than symbol so this creates a
arrow symbol and then a curly bracket
start and stop and you can press enter
to move these stop brackets
to the next line so that we get some
space to write our
test steps so this is how
we can create a
in playwright
okay
here is the
screenshot of the same thing
and you can see here
this is how we create the test now here
uh to
create a browser test
we have to
here
pass up the fixture or a fixture called
page now do not worry i will uh tell you
more about this in detail
uh in the coming sessions but for now
just you have to go here
and give a curly bracket start and stop
and say page this is a page fixture and
you can also see it is a coming from
playwright and you can see it says
isolated page instance created for each
test each test pages are isolated
between test due to fixture content so
don't worry about all this as of now
just create a fixture or just pass this
page here within curly brackets
and then using this page
object
i can now use the functions so for
example i can say go to go back go
forward
so go to is the
command we used to visit a url and
within the course i will give the url so
you can give any url of your application
for now i will just go to
google.com so i will say
https.google.com
now
if i try to run this so if i
run this using the command
npx i hope you remember the command that
we used to run the playwright test it is
npx playwright
test and because i want to run this
specific file i will
give the file location or name
so i will say
my first
test dot
spec dot gs and if i hit enter let us
see i will also expand this
so that you can see
and you can see there is a
error here
and here
it is saying
here you can see it is showing this
page dot go to
and it has aborted now
for this
what we'll have to do is
i will have to
use
async keyword here
here i will use
await
so i'm using async and await now here
the async
keyword
before any function makes the function
to return a promise
now promise is something so let's say
the function
returns something so we are actually
waiting and we are making sure that this
function returns something returns a
promise and
the await
keyword before any function makes the
function to wait for a promise now do
not get confused here uh in very very
simple words
javascript is a asynchronous programming
language and
in very simple words asynchronous means
not happening at the same time now if we
do not use this javascript by nature is
asynchronous that it will it will not uh
wait for one thing to complete before
starting the next thing it will not wait
for the first step to complete before uh
starting the next step but in our case
in automation testing
we want the uh execution to go
sequentially in the sense that the first
step should complete and then only the
next step should get executed now here
for example
if i do not use async and await
it will
not wait for this page to get loaded
completely and then move forward to the
second step it will just run this step
will not wait for the page to load
completely and go to the next step and
it may happen that the page is not
loaded completely and our next step will
fail and therefore we use a weight here
and async so that all these functions
will return some promise now if you want
if you just go to this
go to function you can press ctrl or
command on your keyboard control key and
then this will turn into a link and if
you click here you can see
this is the
function and if you go down you will see
it should be
returning some promise so you can see it
is returning a promise here
and therefore we are using this
async and wait here away it means this
will now wait for the promise to be
returned and then only it will go to the
next step
so next i can again say i can use expect
for any assertion and i can now here say
expect
this page to have some title and i can
check it has the title so i will say
page
dot
to
have and you can see so many things here
to have length property to have title
and i will say the title should be
google so in general also if you go to
google here the title of the page is
google so this is what i will check
and now
again i will use await
so that it waits for this to complete
and then only moves to the
```

```20:30-28:20:lesson04/lesson-04-transcript.md
i will now
run and check again
i will save this save the file
go to the terminal
clear the terminal
press the up arrow on my keyboard to go
to the last
command and run the command and let's
see now
and yes it is now running
and you can see it is
running three tests that means it is
running on three browsers using one
worker
and let me see uh looks like
some issue
i'll also expand this make it full
screen so i can see all the logs here
so here it says
there is some issue in the assertion
okay i think this is fine uh we had made
a mistake i had made this mistake here
so expected was this which i which was a
typo from my end and received this
google so actually this is good that we
are able to also check that it is all
running fine and
let us see the report as well so report
it is running here and here also you can
see it is saying expected was this but
actual was this so i can go and change
this and make it pass
so i will change this to google it is
it was a typo here
it should be google here
and now if i run
it should work fine and uh i can also
run in a edit mode so that you can see
so i will say hyphen hyphen edit
let us run and check now
so it should now run on a physical
browser and yes it is going to google
and checking the
title it is done on chrome it is now
running on firefox
and then it will run on webkit
and yes it is running and everything is
fine it looks like everything is passed
and now you can check the report by
running this command or directly go to
the
report
folder which is playwright report and
check the report from here and you can
see this to have title is coming from
the expect a script or module again i
can click on this i can
press control on my keyboard and click
here and you can see it is go it has
gone here and this must also be
returning a promise you can see it is
returning a promise and similarly you
will find
a lot of assertions here so if i show
you
let me
go here
let me go to this expect
i'm going to display write a test
library
and here i will go to the lib and go to
expect.js this is what we have included
all these different
assertions that we can use
so you will find all the sessions here
so we have to be checked to be disabled
to be visible
to have title to have count to have text
to have id so all this we can use in our
test in playwright tests so this is how
we create
```

```28:20-33:30:lesson04/lesson-04-transcript.md
if you want you can take a screenshot of
this screen and keep it handy with you
and watch it multiple times so that it
will always be it will be very clear to
you how to create tests in playwright
and then you will be good with creating
tests in playwright in the coming
sessions we will see more options more
ways and
more things to do with test hooks and
all the other things that we can do with
test i hope this was very useful for you
thank you for watching and never stop
learning
